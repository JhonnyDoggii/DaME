# DaME
DaME: Data-Aware Metadata Enricher which extracts, analyzes, and enriches geospatial metadata from vector and raster layers in QGIS. It generates structured metadata outputs (JSON and XML), suitable for spatial data infrastructures (SDIs), FAIR data pipelines, research data management, and geospatial data catalogs.
The plugin performs intelligent scanning of spatial extents, coordinate reference systems, geometry types, attribute information, and raster statistics, producing standardized metadata summaries and human-readable dataset descriptions. Bounding boxes are accurately reprojected to WGS84 (EPSG:4326), ensuring interoperability across geospatial platforms.
Optional large language model (LLM) integration enables automatic field name translation and advanced description enhancement, improving dataset clarity and usability for international and interdisciplinary workflows.
Designed for researchers, data managers, and GIS professionals, the plugin integrates seamlessly into the QGIS Processing framework, enabling one-click execution and batch automation.
